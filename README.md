A primer in design experiments.

gemcityML 2023 March Meetup

## Details

## Why Design an Experiment

It cost money to run experiment, train algorithms and implement algorithms.
<br>
We saw this in March's meetup where initially one needed to upgrade to Pro Colab.
But then we saw that we could reduce sample size and runtime. 
Which might have allowed us to scrapped by with the free version of Colab. 

<br>
There are mathematical models you can use to identify what is the number of sample you need to get good results.

<br>
In addition, not knowing how to adjust your experiment to meet the risk, can **cost you your job** and or the company a lot of money.

<br>
Recently, Google debuted their version of ChatGPT. This was a high risk demo. It also failed and cost the company $100B in valuation. 

<br>
You need to know how to adjust your experiments for the risk.

This is where design experimentation comes in. How does one adjust for risk while reducing the cost of running the experiment.

<br>

One way to reduce cost and risk is to set-up an A/B Test.

## Other:

I will have a side by side comparison of some of the Image Generators and how they compare using the same text "Pull Tab Christmas Tree".
Would LOVE to see your comparisons too!

You can also connect anytime through Gem City Tech Discord Server.
Always looking for suggestions for next talk.
The Gem City Machine Learning (ML) group is part of the GemCity TECH family of user communities.
Each month we meet at the Innovation Hub located in the newly renovated Dowtown Dayton Arcade.
We meet to explore the exciting and growing field of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
We regularly meet on the third Thursday of the month. You can find our next event on the GemCity TECH Meetup events calendar.

Would you like to discover more about machine learning or artificial intelligence?

* Are you interested in being part of a community who are also interested in exploring the field of machine learning?
* Do you work in the field of machine learning and would like to share your knowledge and experience?
* Our goal is to have a space where people can present and learn new ML/AI ideas,
ask for help on problems they are working on, and meet new people.

We have short talks about machine learning (ML) and how to get into this field.

The format is:

* Social: ~ 30 min
* Lecture: ~ 1 hour
* Social: ~ 30 min
